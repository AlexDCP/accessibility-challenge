# <Week-1-Challenge>

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to have us use the git process as we clean code in the CSS and HTML files to help with accessibility. 


## Installation

In order to help with accessibility, I added alt tags to all of the images and corrected the link for "search engine optimization". In doing that along with a slight change in color on one of the boxes of information I was able to achieve a 100% on a desktop score. Along with that I went through the code and removed some redundancies inc the style sheet and added a headed tag in the HTML.
